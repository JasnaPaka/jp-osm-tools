# Create offline maps for Czech Republic and Slovakia

In this directory you can find scripts for Windows Powershell. With these scripts you can create maps of Czech 
Republic and Slovakia for offline use. Both are based on free data from [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) 
project.

## Requirements
* Java 1.6 or higher
* Windows Powershell 3.0 or higher
* .NET Framework 4.5 or higher

Tested on Windows 10. In this system you just need to install Java Runtime (JRE).

## How to use
* Check if you have enough free space on your harddrive (a few GB should be fine).
* Clone this repository.
* Run script 'create-offline-map-czech-republic.ps1' (for Czech Republic map) or 
  *create-offline-map-slovakia.ps1* (for Slovak map).

All required tools should be downloaded and process should start after that. It can take a few hours to 
create offline map (depends on how good PC do you have). Result is binary map *czech_republic.osm.map* or
*slovakia.osm.map*.
